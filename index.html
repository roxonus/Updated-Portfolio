                        <p class="bio"> I was born in 1981 in a small town in upstate New York called New Lebanon.
                            When I say small town I mean it. My high school was grade 7 to grade 12 and there were only 350 kids in the school.
                            I graduated from high school and spent a couple years in community college studying moslty the arts as I always wanted to be an actor growing up.
                            At 18 I started a band and I never looked back.<br><br> That band was called Hed 1st and we played for about 6 years all over New York State and Massachusetts.
                            I got a job as a masons tender helping build brick houses, wood burning masonry firplaces and stone walls and patios.
                            This became my trade that I would continue to practice for the next 20 years.<br><br>
                            The band broke up and I moved to Chicago to start a new band with some friends I met while playing with touring bands in New York.
                            I got a job in Chicago geared more toward masonry restoration instead of custom residential masonry.
                            The band I put together in chicago was called Vile Display of Humanity and I would continue to create music with this band for the next 10 years.
                            After 2 years in Chicago we decided to pack up and move to Seattle together in 2009.<br><br>
                            I continued to work as a mason while playing music with VDH from 2009 until the band broke up in 2017.
                            I decided that playing in a band was something that I couldn't continue to dedicate so much time to after my son, Logan was born in 2014.
                            I found new passion in renewing my love for fishing and teaching myself to learn to ice skate.
                            I honed my skating skills so that I could sign up to play Hockey which was always a love of mine but never had the guts to try.
                            In 2018 I became a right wing, number 22 on the Seattle Stingers in the Greater Seattle Hockey League.
                            I've scored 7 goals and 17 assists in 67 games with the Stingers.<br><br>
                            I decided to apply for the University of Washington Fullstack Coding Bootcamp in 2020 because construction seemed to be a dead end career path with very limited options.
                            I would like to become a web developer and prove that I can be as successful with my brain as I am with my body.
